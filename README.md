# Meal Builder/Generator

This project is designed to generate 4 ingredients you can combine to cook a healthy dinner if you plan on visiting the grocery store. From top to bottom, it will generate a protein, vegetable, healthy carb side, and healthy fat

## Ingredients

I believe in a diet consisting of foods that are beneficial for your GI or 'gut health'. Every ingredient generated is a food that has been proven to be, at the minimum, a healthier alternative to any other canned, jarred, frozen, or otherwise processed food that is out there.

### NOTE:

As of now, this app unfortunately does not cater to a vegan diet. Will create a vegan component soon!
